### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github!

I have spent the last 7 years in higher education studying Physics and Astronomy. I have learned how to work with large data sets to come to conclusions 
about physical properties of something as large as a galaxy to something as small as electrons on the surface of metal. I want to translate the 
programming, data interpretation, and machine learning skills I have gained to industry data.

I love public speaking and educating. My favorite part of my experience in Astronomy was giving talks about my research and I also loved tutoring students. 
I am skilled with translating high level topics into digestible language that can be understood by folks who do not have expertise in the subject.
