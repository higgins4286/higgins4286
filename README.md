# üëã Hello there! 

<i>Welcome to my github! I am so glad you found me!</i> &#128513;

## &#128064; What you'll find here 
Contained in my github are all of my coding projects and the raw .tex files for technical reports and publications that I have authored. I code primarily 
in Python, but I have experience with LaTex, JavaScript, MatLab, SQL, and HTML. Additionally, I am working towards expanding my language skills to R and 
C++.

## &#128105;&#127996; About me
#### Pronouns: She/Her/Hers </br> Email: lahn7d@mail.umkc.edu
I have spent the last 7 years in higher education studying Physics and Astronomy. I have learned how to work with large data sets to come to conclusions 
about physical properties of objects as large as a galaxy to objects as small as electrons on the surface of metal. I graduate with an MS in Physics this 
January. I want to translate the programming, data interpretation, and machine learning skills I have gained to industry data. Additionally, I love 
public speaking and educating. I am skilled with translating high level topics into digestible language that can be understood by folks who do not have 
expertise in the subject. My favorite part of my experience in Astronomy was giving talks about my research. Along with creating algorithms, I aim to make 
public speaking as a prominent aspect of my professional life.

### &#129349; My Goals 
I want to increase my object oriented programming skills and I want to increase my fluency in Java, R, and C++. To achieve these goals, I am currently 
working through Java, R, and C++ tutorials on w3schools. If you have any other helpful suggestions, I'd love to hear them!
