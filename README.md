# üëã Hello there! 

<i>Welcome to my github! I so am glad you found me!</i> &#128513;

## &#128064; What you'll find here
Contained in my github are all of my coding projects and the raw .tex files for technical reports and publications that I have authored. I code primarily in Python, but I have experience with LaTex, JavaScript, MatLab, and HTML. Additionally, am working towards expanding my language skills to R and C++.

## &#128105;&#127996; About me
I have spent the last 7 years in higher education studying Physics and Astronomy. I have learned how to work with large data sets to come to conclusions 
about physical properties of objects as large as a galaxy to objects as small as electrons on the surface of metal. I graduate with an MS in Physics this 
December.  I want to translate the programming, data interpretation, and machine learning skills I have gained to industry data. Specifically, I am 
interested in deep learning algorithms utilized Anti Money Laundering, Human Resources, Clean Energy, and self driving cars.

I love public speaking and educating. My favorite part of my experience in Astronomy was giving talks about my research and I also loved tutoring students. 
I am skilled with translating high level topics into digestible language that can be understood by folks who do not have expertise in the subject.

## &#129349; My Goals 
I want to increase my object oriented programming skills and I want to increase my fluency in Java, R, and 
C++. To achieve these goals, I am currently working through a YouTube tutorial entitled "Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding 
Challenges". I am looking for toy examples where I can learn R and C++. If you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!
